BlockFactory has been developed in the [Dynamic Interaction Control](https://dic.iit.it/) research line at the [Italian Institute of Technology](https://www.iit.it).

It used to be the core machinery of @robotology/wb-toolbox. Now it became a standalone and generic tool, not anymore related to robotic applications.
